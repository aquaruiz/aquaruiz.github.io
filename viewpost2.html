                    <p>Three young inventors were received with much applause by the public at the opening ceremony of CEEDS’15 by Webit, the biggest IT event in Eastern Europe. Venezia Georgieva, Nikita Ovsyannikov, and Boris Zyumbyulev, high school students at the American College in Sofia, stand out for winning an international contest held in Vienna this March with a robot that can smoothly cross remote and hardly accessible areas, giving feedback to users.
                        <br /><br />We decided to learn more about the robot, which was part of the so-called Maze Project, and asked the team to tell us more.
                        <br /><br />If you have seen Prometheus, the 2012 sci-fi movie, you might remember the small round widget which was able to fly, scan the area and provide information. If you haven't, you are to read about something inspired by this futuristic device.
                        <br /><br />Something which is better, because it is real. And it was made by students.
                        <br /><br />The Maze Robot’s purpose was to explore further the application of sensors, machines that can detect changes in their environment. To make it more simple, it can also help people explore or get a clearer notion of sites which a human being finds hardly accessible or where remoteness or dimensions make it difficult for anyone to set foot. They say an improved version might be fit for researchers, amateur explorers and tourists alike.
                        <br /><br />The name itself, however, doesn’t hide any complicated metaphors. As Boris, one of the three young inventors, tells us, it was chosen because,“in order to demonstrate how the device works, we made quite a large labyrinth through which it had to pass.” This construction was used both at the school fair and in Vienna. Still, the robot itself is named differently: they decided it should be called “Pepi”, because “at an international festival it should have a Bulgarian name”.
                        <br /><br />What started as a hobby and a science fair project was inspired by Prometheus. "We decided that the idea is great and we wanted to bring it into the real world," Boris explains, but adds that it was the interest in robotics and team work that inspired them to begin.
                        <br /><br />As their report for the Vienna International Science and Engineering Fair reads: The Maze Robot aims to determine if these sensors [Ultrasonic sensors, which use ultrasound, a wave above 20 000 Hz, beyond what the human year can detect] can be used to safely explore unknown areas, such as caves or labyrinths.</p>
